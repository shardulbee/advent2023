# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Last year I think Rust was in vogue so I did (as much as I felt like) in OCaml. This year OCaml is in vogue so naturally I'm doing it in Rust. Call me a square peg in a round hole, please.

## Running

Just run `cargo run` and it will ask you which day you want solutions for, and whether it should run the solution on test or prod data.
